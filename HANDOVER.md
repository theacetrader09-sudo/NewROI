## 👤 User Roles

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| `USER` | Dashboard, deposit, withdraw, network, settings |
| `SUPERADMIN` | Everything + Admin panel at `/admin` |

**To make someone an admin:** Update their `role` to `"SUPERADMIN"` in the database.

---

## 💰 How ROI Works

1. User submits deposit with TXID proof
2. Admin approves → investment becomes `ACTIVE`
3. Every day at midnight, cron job runs `/api/cron/daily-roi`
4. Each active investment earns `dailyRoiPercent` (default: 1% per day, configurable)
5. ROI is added to user's balance
6. Commission flows up to 10 upline levels based on `levelConfig` % settings

---

## 📧 Email System

Two options (set in `.env`):
- **Gmail SMTP** — use `GMAIL_USER` + `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
- **Resend** — use `RESEND_API_KEY` + `FROM_EMAIL`

Emails sent for: OTP verification, withdrawal confirmation, admin notifications.

## 🔄 Cron Job Setup (IMPORTANT)

The daily ROI does NOT run automatically unless you set up a cron trigger.

**Production option:** Use [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) (free) to call:
```
GET https://yourdomain.com/api/cron/daily-roi
Header: x-cron-secret: YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```
Schedule: `0 0 * * *` (midnight daily)
